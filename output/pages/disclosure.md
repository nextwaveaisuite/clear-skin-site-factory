# Disclosure

Clear Skin Australia is an independent skincare guide. To support the cost of running this site (hosting, tools, and content production), we may earn commissions through affiliate partnerships.

This does **not** change the price you pay.

## Affiliate links

Some links on this site may be affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission.

We aim to keep recommendations honest and aligned with the site’s focus: simple, barrier-first skincare that suits Australian conditions.

## Editorial policy (how we choose what to recommend)

We do our best to recommend products based on:

- ingredient approach (especially potential irritants)
- suitability for common skin concerns (sensitivity, dryness, acne-prone skin)
- practicality (availability in Australia, clear product positioning)
- consistency with our “simple routine” philosophy

We do not publish medical advice or claims that a product “treats” named conditions.

## Sponsored content

If we ever publish sponsored content, it will be clearly labelled.

## Important note

Clear Skin Australia provides general skincare information only. We do not offer medical advice or diagnose skin conditions. Always patch test products and consult a qualified professional for medical concerns.
