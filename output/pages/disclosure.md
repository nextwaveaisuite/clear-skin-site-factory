# Disclosure

Clear Skin Australia is an independent skincare education and review website.

To support the cost of running this site — including hosting, tools, research, and content creation — some pages may include **affiliate links**.

This page explains what that means and how it affects (and does not affect) our content.

---

## Affiliate links

Some links on Clear Skin Australia are affiliate links.  
If you click an affiliate link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission **at no extra cost to you**.

Affiliate commissions help keep this site running and allow us to continue publishing free skincare guides and reviews.

Not every link on the site is an affiliate link. In some cases, we link to products or brands for reference or context only.

## How affiliate relationships affect content

Affiliate relationships **do not override** our editorial approach.

Our goal is to publish information that is:
- clear  
- conservative  
- practical  
- relevant to Australian conditions  

We aim to recommend products and routines based on:
- formulation approach  
- suitability for common skin concerns (sensitivity, irritation, acne-prone skin)  
- consistency with a barrier-first routine  

We do **not**:
- accept payment for guaranteed positive reviews  
- allow brands to edit or approve our opinions  
- promote products that require medical or therapeutic claims  

---

## Sponsored content

If we ever publish sponsored content, it will be **clearly labelled** as sponsored.

Sponsored content will not be presented as independent editorial unless explicitly stated.

---

## Our own products

Clear Skin Australia is developing its own skincare range:

**Clear Skin Essentials**

These products are being created to align with the same principles taught throughout this site:
- fragrance-free formulations  
- barrier-first skincare  
- suitability for sensitive and acne-prone skin  
- simple, repeatable routines  

Any content referencing Clear Skin Essentials will be clearly identified as relating to our own products.

---

## No medical advice

All content on Clear Skin Australia is provided for **general informational purposes only**.

We:
- do not provide medical advice  
- do not diagnose skin conditions  
- do not prescribe treatments  

Always patch test new products and consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical concerns.

## Transparency matters

We believe trust is built through transparency.
