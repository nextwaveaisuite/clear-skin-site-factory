# Adult Acne Skincare (Australia)

Adult acne is common — and in Australia it often overlaps with **heat, sweat, shaving, stress, and irritation**. If your skin is also sensitive, aggressive acne routines can make things worse.

This guide focuses on **a gentle, barrier-first approach**.

## The simple adult acne routine (barrier-first)

### 1) Cleanse (don’t strip)
Choose a gentle cleanser that leaves your skin comfortable — not tight.

- If your skin feels tight after washing, your cleanser is likely too harsh.

### 2) Moisturise (yes, even if you break out)
Moisturiser helps reduce irritation-driven breakouts by supporting the barrier.

### 3) Sunscreen (daily)
UV exposure + inflammation is a common “invisible trigger” for angry adult acne.

## What commonly makes adult acne worse

- Over-cleansing
- Harsh exfoliation “because acne”
- Strong fragrance / essential oils on reactive skin
- Swapping products too often
