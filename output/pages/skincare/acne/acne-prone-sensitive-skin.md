# Acne-prone Sensitive Skin (Australia)

If you break out easily **and** react easily, your priority is usually not “stronger acne products”.

Your priority is **less irritation** and **more consistency**.

## The goal

- reduce visible congestion over time
- avoid flare-ups caused by irritation
- keep your routine stable

## A calm routine that works for most people

### Step 1: Gentle cleanser
Choose non-stripping cleansing. If you feel tight or stingy after cleansing, adjust first.

### Step 2: Lightweight moisturiser
Moisturising doesn’t cause acne by default — irritation often does.

### Step 3: Sunscreen
Daily SPF helps reduce inflammation and post-blemish marks.

## What to avoid (especially if you’re reactive)

- multiple actives at once
- strong fragrance and essential oils
- “tingly” products as your daily baseline
