# Best Cleanser for Acne (Australia)

If your cleanser is too harsh, acne routines often backfire — more dryness, more irritation, and more “angry skin”.

## What to look for

- cleans without stripping
- suits daily use
- supports consistency

## Avoid

- harsh daily exfoliating cleansers as your baseline
- “squeaky clean” tight feeling
