# Best Sunscreen for Sensitive Skin (Australia)

In Australia, sunscreen is non-negotiable — but many people with sensitive skin struggle to find one that doesn’t sting.

## What to look for

- comfortable wear (no burning around eyes)
- suitable for daily use
- consistent application is the goal

## Tips to reduce irritation

- apply moisturiser first if you’re dry or reactive
- patch test on a small area
- try one change at a time
