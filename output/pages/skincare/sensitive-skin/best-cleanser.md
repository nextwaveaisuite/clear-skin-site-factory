# Best Cleanser for Sensitive Skin (Australia)

For sensitive or reactive skin, cleanser is often the difference between “calm” and “constant irritation”.

## What to look for

- leaves skin comfortable (not tight)
- no strong fragrance
- simple ingredient approach
- suits daily use (AM/PM)

## Common mistakes

- foaming too aggressively
- cleansing twice with harsh products
- using exfoliating cleansers daily

## Where this fits in a routine

- Cleanser → Moisturiser → Sunscreen (AM)
- Cleanser → Moisturiser (PM)
