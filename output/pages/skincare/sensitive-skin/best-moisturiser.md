# Best Moisturiser for Sensitive Skin (Australia)

If your skin gets red, stings, or flares up, moisturiser should feel like **comfort**, not a “treatment”.

## What to look for

- barrier-support focus
- fragrance-free (or very low fragrance)
- simple, purposeful ingredients
- comfortable finish (not heavy, not sticky)

## What to avoid

- strong fragrance / essential oils if you’re reactive
- lots of “active” products at once
- rotating too many moisturisers (inconsistent routines)
