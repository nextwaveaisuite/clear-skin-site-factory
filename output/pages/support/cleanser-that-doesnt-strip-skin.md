# Cleanser That Doesn’t Strip Your Skin

That tight, squeaky feeling after cleansing is often a sign the skin barrier has been disrupted.

## Why stripping cleansers are a problem
They remove natural oils that help protect and hydrate the skin.

## What to look for
- Low-foam formulas
- Gentle surfactants
- Fragrance-free options

## What to avoid
- Strong foaming agents
- Alcohol-heavy products

## A simple routine approach
Gentle cleansing twice daily is usually enough.

## Where Clear Skin Essentials fits
Clear Skin Essentials cleansers are designed to clean without stripping.
