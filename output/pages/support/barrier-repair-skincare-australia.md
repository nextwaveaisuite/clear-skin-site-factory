# Barrier Repair Skincare in Australia

Barrier repair skincare focuses on helping the skin maintain moisture and resilience — not stripping it.

## Why barrier damage happens
Over-cleansing, harsh actives, climate stress, and fragrance can weaken the skin barrier over time.

## What to look for
- Gentle cleansers
- Lightweight moisturisers
- Consistent routines

## What to avoid
- Over-exfoliation
- Layering too many actives
- Constant product switching

## A simple routine approach
Cleanse gently, moisturise consistently, and give skin time to stabilise.

## Where Clear Skin Essentials fits
Our products are built around barrier-first routines for Australian conditions.
