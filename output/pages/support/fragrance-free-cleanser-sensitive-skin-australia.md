# Fragrance-Free Cleanser for Sensitive Skin in Australia

If your skin feels tight, itchy, or irritated after cleansing, fragrance may be one of the biggest contributors.

For many people with sensitive or reactive skin, **fragrance-free cleansing** is a turning point.

## Why this happens
Fragrance is one of the most common skincare irritants. Even when it smells pleasant, it can disrupt the skin barrier and trigger redness or discomfort — especially with daily use.

## What to look for in a cleanser
- Clearly labelled fragrance-free
- Low-foam or gentle surfactants
- pH-balanced formulas
- Minimal ingredient lists

## What to avoid
- Added perfume or masking fragrance
- Strong foaming agents
- Alcohol-heavy formulas

## A simple routine approach
A gentle cleanser used morning and night, followed by a basic moisturiser, is often more effective than aggressive acne routines.

## Where Clear Skin Essentials fits
Clear Skin Essentials focuses on fragrance-free, barrier-first formulations designed for sensitive and acne-prone skin.
